## 🧩 Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Git

### Local Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mallen220/PedroPathingPlusVisualizer.git
cd PedroPathingVisualizer
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Building

```bash
npm run dist
```

## 🏗️ Project Structure (High-Level)

- `src/` – Svelte UI and core application logic
- `electron/` – Electron main and preload processes
- `public/` – Static assets
- `scripts/` – Build and utility scripts

Try to keep changes scoped and modular.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

- Test your changes on at least one platform (macOS, Windows, or Linux)
- Verify paths load, save, and export correctly
- Avoid introducing UI lag or frame drops
- If adding simulation logic, validate against known robot constraints

Automated testing is evolving—manual validation is currently important.

---

## 🎨 UI & UX Guidelines

- Maintain the existing color semantics:
  - Green = Paths
  - Amber = Waits
  - Pink = Rotations

- Prefer clarity over visual novelty
- Avoid unnecessary dialogs or modal overload
- Keep workflows keyboard-friendly where possible

---

## 🔧 Coding Standards

- Favor readability and maintainability
- Avoid premature optimization
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Keep commits focused and meaningful

Commit messages should be clear and concise:

```
Add path optimizer boundary check
Fix telemetry desync on timeline scrub
```

---

## 🔀 Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
   `git checkout -b feature/YourFeatureName`
3. Commit your changes

4. Push to your fork
   `git push origin feature/YourFeatureName`
5. Open a Pull Request against `main`

Please include:

- What the PR changes
- Why it’s needed
- Any known limitations or follow-ups

---

## 🔌 Plugins

If contributing a plugin:

- Keep it self-contained
- Avoid hard dependencies on internal state where possible
- Document installation and usage
- Follow the same quality and UX standards as core features
